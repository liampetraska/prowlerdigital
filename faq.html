									<section class="section active">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">1.  What is the overall web design process?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Initially, we like to meet face to face with all of our clients before we begin the design process. We understand that this isn't always possible but it goes a long way to help communicate the goals of the site as well as go back and forth on ideas. We discuss initial ideas you have for your site, offer some feedback and answer any questions you may have. Once we have agood idea of what you're trying to accomplish, we'll set a price for the project. This price is final and does not change regardless of the time spent on the project.</p>
                    					  <p>Once the price is agreed upon, we ask that 50% of the final price is paid upfront. After that, we get to work! Within 5-10 business days, we will supply what we like to call a "Live Beta", which is link where you can see our progress on the site. This link is not visible to anyone else on the web. As the site begins to take shape, we'll ask for your content as well as make changes you see along the way. When the site is complete, we ask that the final 50% of the price be paid. Once paid, we upload the finished site to your web host and becomes visible to the world! If you don't have a host and/or domain, we can help you with both!</p>

								    <section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">2.  What services are included with a standard website?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Each site comes with full Statcounter reporting capabilities as well as EmailMeForm databasing. Statcounter allows you to see who is visiting your site in incredible detail. You can see where your visitors are coming from, where they live, how many times they've visited your site and more! The contact forms we integrate into all of our projects are store the information that your visitors input. What does that mean? Every month, we send you an Excel document with every bit of information your form includes so you have a listing of prospective leads! These services are included FREE OF CHARGE with every website.</p>

								  	<section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">3.  What if I already have a site? Can you still help?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Absolutely! Whether you're looking for a refresh or just need help with a specific aspect of your current site, we are happy to work with any previous site you have.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								  	
								  	<section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">4.  Do you price match other competitors?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>We don't officially price match but we are happy to work with any budget. If someone is offering to do your project for an absurdly low price, be wary. In our field of work, the motto "You get what you pay for" is almost always accurate.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								  	 <section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">5.  What form of payment do you accept?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) as well as check and cash. We use Square for our card payments so we are able to accept credit card payments in person or over the phone. Web payments are not yet available.</p>

									<section class="section active">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">1.  What is "Full Service Hosting" and how does it work?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Our hosting is what we consider to be full service, meaning we do the behind the scenes stuff so you don't have to. We've come to realize that in most cases, people know they need hosting but find it difficult to use and understand. That's where we come in. We get you the hosting you need, make sure it's all working properly and maintain it as time goes on.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								    <!-- End:First Accordion -->
								    <section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">2.  Can you transfer my old site to your hosting?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Of course we can and it doesn't charge extra! We've worked with nearly every hosting company in existence so we're able to get your site moved over with no problems whatsoever.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								  	
								  	<section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">3.  Does the $50/yr rate ever increase?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Absolutely NOT. Our $50 hosting plan never increases in price. Almost ALL hosting companies will charge you a cheap introductory offer only to jack the rate sky high as soon as your initial term is up. In many cases, by the time you know your rate when up, they make it near impossible to move your site elsewhere. It's a frustrating and misleading tactic that is unfortunately the norm in this business. We're happy to be the odd ones out and stick with $50!</p>

								<div class="title"><h3>FAQ - Domain Registration</h3></div>
								<div class="docs section-container accordion" data-section="accordion" data-options="one_up: false">
									<!-- Start: First Accordion -->
									<section class="section active">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">1.  What kinds of domains are available?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>We offer nearly any kind of domain available although we strongly recommend that you stick with either .com, .net or .org.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								    <!-- End:First Accordion -->
								    <section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">2.  Can you transfer my old domain to you?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Yep! Much like hosting, you can choose to register your domain with us once your term with another registrar is up. If you choose to transfer your domain to us before your current term is up, your expiration date will just be extended an additional year.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
								  	
								  	<section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">3.  Does my domain include e-mail addresses?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Yes! We offer e-mail addresses with every domain. These email addresses can function normally or redirect to other domains. We have a web-based portal for you to check your emails (like GMail or Yahoo!) and can help you set up your email address with programs like Outlook or your devices like iPhones and iPads.</p>
									    </div>
								  	</section>	
									
									<section class="section ">
									    <p class="title"><a href="#">4.  Are there any extras available with a domain purchase?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>One important "extra" to consider with every domain purchase is called <i>Domain Privacy</i>. When you sign up for a domain, you must supply personal information like your name, address, phone number, etc. This information is stored in a database called WHOIS and is accessible to the public. Domain Privacy allows you to hide this information from the public. While it is not mandatory by any means, you should always ask yourself how private you want to be with your information when creating a website. If you'd like to keep your information private, Domain Privacy is highly recommended.</p>

									    <p class="title"><a href="#">1.  When you say "IT Solutions", what do you mean?</a></p>
									    <div class="content">
									      <p>Anyone that works in IT professionally will tell you that they basically do anything and everything when it comes to technology. Broken computers, viruses and so much more are considered an IT problem. So when we say we offer IT solutions, it means that we can help you with just about everything when it comes to your computer (Macs included)!</p>

									    <div class="content">
									      <p>As opposed to web design, we charge an hourly rate for IT help. Our rates vary depending on the issue so be sure to contact us! We can get you a quote almost immediately. Our rates are far lower than most other companies and we treat you (and your device) like family! We document all work we do and even show you how to avoid the problem in the future!</p>

		 	 	 			<p>Choosing a company to help you with your website is very important. Look for these signs that the company you're considering may not be the best fit for your needs:</p>
							 <ul>
							 	<li>Confusing pricing or extra fees</li>
							 	<li>Lack of communication or unable to communicate clearly</li>
							 	<li>Doesn't listen to your needs</li>
							 	<li>Services include too many "extras" or none at all</li>

						 <div  class="widget">
		 	 	 			<div class="title"><h3>Are You Ready?</h3></div>
		 	 	 			<p>One of the most important steps to your site is getting your information together! Consider the following when thinking about your site:</p>
							 <ul>
							 	<li>Do you have a logo? If so, is it formatted for use on the web? (If not, we can help!)</li>
							 	<li>What colors do you want to use? A consistent color scheme is important!</li>
							 	<li>Is your information typed out and organized properly? Be sure to proofread!</li>
							 	<li>How private do you want to be with your personal information?</li>
							 	<li>What is the end goal of the site? Sales? Brand recognition?</li>
							 	<li>Will you integrate your site into other marketing efforts? </li>
